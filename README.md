# vscode-quake3
Quake 3 engine support for Visual Studio Code


## Reasoning

Often in development we're burdened by the architechure of waiting for compiling to finish. Lots of time wasted rebuilding that is unavoidable. However, there are also microcosms of wasted time in things we take for granted like switching windows. The primary objective is to learn how to make a visual studio code extension. The secondary objective is to work on a game engine inside the context of the coding tool, in the same window, just like Unreal engine, Godot, etc.

This project is inspired by VSCode Live Preview

This project heavily depends on https://github.com/briancullinan2/Quake3e/tree/wasm-support-squashed


## Build Instructions

TODO: same as VSCode demo instructions?
